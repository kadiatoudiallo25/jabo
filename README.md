first off i am still a CC student, will change soon lol

I wanted to make a sort of social media/blog site for CC students to express themselves. 
Their wishes to transfer, the things their schools offer, and their overall experience.
There should be different tabs to express their home institutions and coursework, the classes that are/aren't available,
housing if it exsts and what it's like, differnet partnerships they have with other 4 year institutions, etc.
